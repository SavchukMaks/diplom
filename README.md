Demo project based on Laravel 6 which implements calendar with [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io) JavaScript library, and with a few different sources (from different Laravel models) on the same calendar.

Also, it adds a filter dropdown on top to search for particular data - in this case, venues for events.

Project is partly generated with [QuickAdminPanel]
